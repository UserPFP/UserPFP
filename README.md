# UserPFP

UserPFP provides an alternative source for Profile pictures, currently only supported for Discord, and allows for GIFs and custom APIs, e.g. to randomise your image on each load.

## Using UserPFP

To use UserPFP, you have to install or import a plugin or theme on a modified Discord client. Currently supported clients are:

[Pyoncord](https://github.com/pyoncord) using a plugin

[Vencord](https://vencord.dev) using a theme ([Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) includes a plugin)

[Betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) using a theme

[Replugged](https://replugged.dev/) using a plugin-theme hybrid

After that, you will have to submit a profile picture for review, either using the plugin settings on supported platforms or by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/userpfp-1129784704267210844)
